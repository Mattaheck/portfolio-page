For this project I used HTML CSS and Javascript.  Also employing jQuery and Bootstrap.
I researched other sites first off but realized those might be a bit above my head so I tried to follow the model of the demo and make some customizations.  I started over probably 3-4 times before getting a working concept.
my hamburger nav bar and carousel-indicators still don't work.  
also my quotes section starts with all three slowly going down to one.
Javascript was by far my biggest challenge, I spent three quarters of the time on this trying to figure out the JS portion.  my biggest win was the fact that I set out to make a work in progress personal site for myself and I think I did that.
